# Pose Thumbnails

Pose Thumbnails is a simple add-on which adds the ability to have thumbnails for the poses in a Pose Library.

## Installation

Download and put the 'pose_thumbnails' folder in your Blender addons folder or use the 'Install from File...' option within Blender.

## Usage

Just create a pose library, add poses and start adding thumbnails. You can assign thumbnails to individual poses or 'batch' assign more images at once.
Now just click on the thumbnails to apply a pose.

**_TIP:_** If you used the old version of this add-on, you can simply add the thumbnails you created for that by clicking 'Batch Add/Change' and then choose 'Index' as mapping method.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/jasperges/pose-thumbnails/wiki) for more documentation.

#### Notes

When making thumbnails for your poses, consider the following:

- Make sure your thumbnails are square images, else they will be stretched.
- Give them proper names, so you know for which poses they are. :)
