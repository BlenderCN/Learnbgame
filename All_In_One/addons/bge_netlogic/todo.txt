--- TODO ---
add distance condition, with hysteresis
remove status check
check action started/finished behavior for LOOP and PING PONG
test multiple animation controls
add joystick input control
add movie player
more arithmetic ops
find a way to add a "group" node.
add multiline comments
finish templates
--- DONE ---
0.3.0
More math
0.2.9
KeyLogger (add a character logger node (when user types something, log it as a character))
String operations
0.2.8
Add Vec4 parameter
Removed status waiting from Vec cell
Added distance_ref, distance_max to start/update sound
Fixed cast error in update sound node ui
Removed status check for start/update sound
Add Start Game
Add Restart Game
Fixed value changed condition (missing reset line cause the condition to keep the triggered status)
0.2.7
Repeater node, added indexed outputs to predict evaluation order. It also makes clearer that there can be multiple outputs.
Repeater node now has a condition input.
0.2.6
The auto-update-trees on open file doesn't work because the invoked operator only updates the current tree. Fixes requires a procedure that doesn't depend
on the context (to avoid writing two functions that do the same stuff).
add Repeater node: executes the linked node once for each element of an input set / number
add Colliding Objects / OPN list output to collision node.
0.2.5
add custom node templates
changed ActionFindGameObject to fix a status waiting issue, implemented parent and branch root
0.2.4
add condition None
add world to screen
add screen to world
0.2.3
add a set scene node
0.2.2
add constant value node
fixed value changed node (previous value is now updated during reset)
add align axis to vect node
0.2.1
FIXED - crash on open blend file via double click (check context.window is not None)
add replace mesh node
0.2.0
ConditionCollision used to stay True after the first collision was detected. Changed to reset its status every logic frame.
Now the condition should become False as soon as the collision exits.
0.1.9
fix category name (Cinematic nodes to Cinematic Nodes)
0.1.8
Add bitmap font like function
Fix for PermissionError when the file has not been saved
Renamed "apply value to game object" to "apply motion/rotation/force/torque"
Moved "apply value to game object" not to "Basic Cinematic Nodes" category
Renamed "The Powa!" to "Force Code Update"
Renamed "Refresh Custom Nodes" to "Refresh Imported Nodes"
0.1.7
add Translate action
set note node to 6 default
add game object's parent parameter
renamed remove parent to detach child from parent
0.1.6
in Play action changed label GameObject to Armature
add Action Time Barrier
add time nodes group
change default python parameter to print only if in0 is True
parameter vector returns a copy of the vector
add Normalized Vector output to Vector parameter
add Action Time Filter
add early out and None checks to Add Object
0.1.5
fixed bugs in CondtionValueChanged (leftovers from previous)
add Condition Or List
add Condition And List
None is now a valid value for eq and neq Logic Op
0.1.4
add navigation with nav mesh
categorized more basic nodes
add Value Filter 3 node
add Note Node
add Move To
add Rotate To
add Move To with Navmesh
add Follow path
add Parameter Distance
add Condition Distance
add Action set game object visibility
0.1.3
changed parameter mouse data impl
fixed missing set ready on bone status
add dwheel to mouse data node
add import math to tree module imports
add mouse wheel condition
fixed a bug with condition value changed (old value was changed immediately to new value)
test set game object dynamics
set action frame now plays a frame of an action (instead of setting the current frame of a playing action)
test set action frame
test stop action
install subnetwork: if the network is already installed, start it if the installer is set to start
in UpdateSound volume and attenuation should be optionally NULL, to not to change the current value
0.1.2
test stop installed subnetwork
test install subnetwork
test start installed subnetwork
test remove game object parent
fixed remove parent action name
fixed remove parent node color
fixed color of set game object parent node
test set game object parent
test end scene
arithmetic op now returns None if one or both operands are None
set game object member: not all predefined values are writable. Create a != enum for it
added parameter formatted string
added deactivation to cell type
replace global properties with db properties
added serial sorting to network
fixed max step bug in logic network cycle
add random generator
0.1.1
add default to python parameters for debugging
add mouse clicked condition
use a cache for ray cast (same scene, same property, same camera, distance <= : recycle last available values instead of computing a new one every time)
test sound nodes
add end game
fix distance bug for mouse targeting
0.1.0
add action play sound
add armature constraints nodes
test camera pick
test autoload per project items on save file
